      h2 Slipped Disc
      p Slipped Disc plays the dynamic, swinging music of 1940s-era small group jazz. Influenced by the Benny Goodman Sextet and Artie Shawâ€™s Gramercy Five, this ensemble features a front-line trio of clarinet, vibraphone and guitar over tight and swinging rhythm. Since 2008, the Vancouver-based group has been delighting listeners and dancers alike with their unique blend of simple, catchy swing riffs, driving rhythms, and tight ensemble arrangements.

      p How Short plays happy jazz, the kind that gets you out of your seat and moving. Their repertoire includes old classics from the Great American Songbook and unique arrangements of more recent tunes, but it all swings hard. Backed by a rhythmic accordion, lightning fast guitar, and a dizzyingly melodious clarinet, Andy and Josh's magic blend of vocals will keep you dancing all night long.

      h2 DJ Taylor Stender

      p While Taylor's love for jazz predates her dance obsession, she found her passion when  the two came together.  Hailing (or should we say "raining") from Seattle, Taylor has been DJing regionally and locally since 2013. She takes joy in creating the best possible dance environment through song selection and loves to keep shoes a shuffling with up-tempo tunes.  When Taylor is behind the table you will be sure to hear songs from her favorite artists: Jimmie Lunceford, Count Basie, and Sidney Bechet. She enjoys interacting with dancers while she DJs; so if you like what you hear come talk music, if you don't like what you hear you can always talk about shoes.
