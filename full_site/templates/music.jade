      p Jose started listening to and collecting Jazz before he graduated high school and his passion for it continued to grow as he began traveling for Lindy Hop & Balboa events. Nowadays he regularly DJs at social dances and events in his home scene and occasional out-of-town gigs. Jose's taste in Swing Jazz centers around early 1930s to late 1940s music pulled from Benny, Artie, Duke, Lunceford, Basie and a handful more. He has a keen interest in digging up live recordings and radio broadcasts, as well as obscure groups and music for dancers.
