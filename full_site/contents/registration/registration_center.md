The __Northwest Balboa Festival__ is back for its second year! We never thought last year's party would be such a great turnout, and hope to make 2016 better than ever! With more dancing, more music, more guided practices, and more afternoon socials, this year's Northwest Balboa Festival will be the hallmark of the Pacific Northwest's amazing dancing community.
