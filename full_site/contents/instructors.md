__Chris and Beth Grover__ both started dancing in 1998 and have been teaching, competing and performing together since 2004. They are influenced by the vintage dance styles made popular by the Southern California dancers in the 1930′s and 1940′s, and they have had the privilege of learning from many of the first generation Lindy Hop and Balboa dancers who grew up in Los Angeles during those early years. Chris and Beth teach with an emphasis on partner connection and fluidity, and are passionate about preserving the spirit and energy of the original dances. Some of their recent competition wins include the International Balboa Championships at Balboa Rendezvous, the Open Balboa & Swing Classic at California Balboa Classic, and the Open Balboa Strictly at Rocky Mountain Balboa Blowout.
