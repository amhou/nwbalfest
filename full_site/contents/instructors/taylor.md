__Taylor Stender__ has found a way to dance most of her life.  In the last several years she has been broadening her Balboa through travel and being active in the bubbling scene in Seattle.  She has had the opportunity to spread the joy of shuffling locally and throughout the Pacific Northwest for the past 4 years.  If Taylor isn't twirling on the dance floor, she is twirling the hair of anyone who will sit still in front of her, all while amassing more shoes than common sense.
